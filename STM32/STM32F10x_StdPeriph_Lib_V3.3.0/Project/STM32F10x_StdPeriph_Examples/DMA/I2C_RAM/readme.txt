@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use two DMA channels to transfer a 
data buffer from memory to I2C2 through I2C1.

I2C1 is set as the master transmitter and I2C2 as the slave receiver. DMA1 Channel5 is
configured to store the data received from I2C2 into the Rx buffer (reception buffer).
DMA1 Channel6 is configured to transfer data from the Tx buffer (transmission buffer)
to the I2C1 DR register. After the generation of the Start condition and once the slave
address has been acknowledged, DMA capability is enabled for both I2C1 and I2C2. 
As soon as the two I2C DMAEN bits are set in the I2C1_CR2 and I2C2_CR2 registers, 
the transmission of the Tx buffer is started by DMA1 Channel5 and at the same time the
data received on I2C2 is stored in Rx buffer using DMA1 Channel6 .
The transmitted and the received buffers are compared to check that all data have been
correctly transferred.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity-Line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11) are 
    already used by Ethernet PHY module. 
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Medium-Density Value line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11)
    are already used by HDMI-CEC module.     

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin    
      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_dma.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c   
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c   
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)  
        
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.
