@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regulate period the WWDG counter using the
Early Wakeup interrupt (EWI).

The WWDG timeout is set to 87.42ms on Value line devices and to 58.25 ms on other
devices, the refresh window is set to 65 and the EWI is enabled. When the WWDG 
counter reaches 64, the EWI is generated. In the WWDG ISR, the counter is 
refreshed to prevent a WWDG reset and LED2 is toggled.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the falling edge of the signal.
In the NVIC (nested vectored interrupt controller), the EXTI Line interrupt
vector is enabled with a priority equal to 0 and the WWDG interrupt vector is
enabled with a priority equal to 1 (EXTI IT > WWDG IT).

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the Key push-button, the corresponding interrupt is served.
In the ISR, the LED2 turns off and the EXTI Line pending bit is not cleared.
So the CPU executes the EXTI Line ISR indefinitely and the WWDG ISR is never
executed (the WWDG counter is not updated).
As a result, when the WWDG counter falls to 63, the WWDG reset occurs.
If the WWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 turns on.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the WWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the WWDG ISR, and there is no WWDG reset.

In this example the system clock is set to 24 MHz on Value line devices and to 
72 MHz on other devices.
