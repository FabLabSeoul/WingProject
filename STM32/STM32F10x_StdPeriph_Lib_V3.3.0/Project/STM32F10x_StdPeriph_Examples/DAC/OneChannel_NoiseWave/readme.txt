@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use one DAC channel to generate a signal with noise
waves on DAC Channel1 output.

DAC channel1 conversion are configured to be triggered by software with noise wave 
generation.12bit left data alignement is selected since we choose to acces DAC_DHR12L1
register. Bits 0 to 8 are masked for the Linear feedback shift register. 
DAC channel1 is then enabled. DAC Channel1 DHR12L1 register is configured to have
an output voltage of VREF/2.

Software triggers are generated continuously in an infinite loop, and on each
trigger the DAC channel1 start the conversion and calculate the noise value to
apply on the DAC channel1 output.

The output signal with noise waves can be visualized by connecting PA.04 pin to
an oscilloscope.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_dac.c  
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)   
        
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
