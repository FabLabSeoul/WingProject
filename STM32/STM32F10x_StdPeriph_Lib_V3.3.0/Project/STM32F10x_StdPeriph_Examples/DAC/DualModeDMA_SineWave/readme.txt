@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use DAC dual channel mode with DMA to generate sine
waves on both DAC channels outputs.

Both DAC channels conversions are configured to be triggered by TIM2 TRGO triggers
and without noise/triangle wave generation. 12bit right data alignement is selected
since we choose to acces DAC_DHR12RD register. DMA2 channel4 is configured to
transfer continuously, word by word, a 32-word buffer to the dual DAC register
DAC_DHR12RD.

The transfered 32buffer is made to have a sine wave generation on each DAC channel 
output. Both DAC channels are then enabled. Only DAC channel2 DMA capability is enabled.

Once TIM2 is enabled, each TIM2 TRGO update event generate a DMA request which
transfer data to the dual DAC register and DAC conversion is started. The sine
waves can be visualized by connecting both PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, XL-Density,
    Medium-Density Value line and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line) and 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) evaluation boards and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope 
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up  
    - Only PA.04 can be monitored on an oscilloscope, PA.05 is used by other
      module (Motor control connector) that prevents to have DAC channel output
      on it. However, if you don't use Motor control connector, you can remove
      the 0ohm resistor R84 and thus PA.05 can be used for DAC output.
    @note Make shure that jumper JP15 is open.
        
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope    

    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_dac.c 
  - stm32f10x_dma.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)   
      
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
