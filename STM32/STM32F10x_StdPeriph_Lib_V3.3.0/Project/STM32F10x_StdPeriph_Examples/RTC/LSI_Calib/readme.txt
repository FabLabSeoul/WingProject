@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the LSI clock source auto
calibration to get a precise RTC clock. 
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM5 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler. 

The Low Speed External (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler is set with the default value (40000). 
The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC Second signal to be inaccurate. This
signal is output on the Tamper pin (PC.13) and can be measured by on oscilloscope
or a frequencymeter.

The program waits until Key Push button is pressed to begin the auto calibration procedure:
 - Configure the TIM5 to remap internally the TIM5 Channel 4 Input Capture to the
   LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM5 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   Second value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done a led connected to PF.07 is turned ON to indicate the
    end of this operation. At this moment, you can  monitor the Second signal on
    an oscilloscope to measure its accuracy again.

The RTC Second signal can be monitored either on Tamper pin or on LED1 which is 
toggled into the RTC Second interrupt service routine.

    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PD.07 and PD.13 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to PB.09 pin

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PF.06 and PF.07 pins
    - Use the Key push button connected to PG.08 pin
