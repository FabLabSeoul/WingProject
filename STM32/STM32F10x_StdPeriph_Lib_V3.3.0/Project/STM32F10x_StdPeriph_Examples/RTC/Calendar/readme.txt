@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the RTC peripheral. 
As an application example, it demonstrates how to setup the RTC peripheral, in terms
of prescaler and interrupts, to be used to keep time and to generate Second interrupt. 

The Low Speed External (LSE) clock is used as RTC clock source. 
The RTC clock can be output on the Tamper pin (PC.13). To enable this functionality,
uncomment the corresponding line: #define RTCClockOutput_Enable in the main.c file.

The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin. 
A key value is written in backup data register1 (BKP_DR1) to indicate if the RTC
is already configured.

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register1 value:
    - register1 value not correct: (BKP_DR1 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and the user is asked to set the time (entered on HyperTerminal).
    
    - register1 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      is displayed on HyperTerminal.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

In the RTC interrupt service routine, the LED1 toggles every 1 s.
The C library printf function is retargeted to the USART, that is, the printf
message is output to the HyperTerminal using USART1 or USART2 depending on the 
EVAL board you are using.
