@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic communication between USARTy (Synchronous mode) 
and SPIy using flags. USARTy and SPIy can be USART1 and SPI1 or USART2 and SPI3,
depending on the STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

First, the USARTy sends data from TxBuffer1 buffer to SPIy using USARTy TXE flag.
Data received, using RXNE flag, by SPIy is stored in RxBuffer2 then compared with
the sent ones and the result of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus1" 
variable.
 
Then, the SPIy sends data from TxBuffer2 buffer to USARTy using SPIy TXE flag.
Data received, using RXNE flag, by USARTy is stored in RxBuffer1 then compared with
the sent ones and the result of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus2" 
variable.

USARTy configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
  - USART Clock enabled
  - USART CPOL: Clock is active high
  - USART CPHA: Data is captured on the second edge 
  - USART LastBit: The clock pulse of the last data bit is output to the SCLK pin

SPIy configured as follow:
  - Direction = 2 Lines FullDuplex
  - Mode = Slave Mode
  - DataSize = 8 Bits
  - CPOL = Clock is active high
  - CPHA = Data is captured on the second edge 
  - NSS = NSS Software
  - First Bit = First Bit is the LSB

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density)
    and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    This example can't be tested with STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity-Line) evaluation
    board since the USART CK pins are already used by other on-board modules.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in USART/Synchronous/platform_config.h file

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to SPI1_MOSI(PA.07), USART1_Rx(PA.10) to 
      SPI1_MISO(PA.06) and USART1_CK(PA.08) to SPI1_SCK(PA.05).      

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to SPI1_MOSI(PA.07), USART1_Rx(PA.10) to 
      SPI1_MISO(PA.06) and USART1_CK(PA.08) to SPI1_SCK(PA.05).

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to SPI1_MOSI(PA.07), USART1_Rx(PA.10) to 
      SPI1_MISO(PA.06) and USART1_CK(PA.08) to SPI1_SCK(PA.05).        
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_spi.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
     
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit USART/Synchronous/platform_config.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.
