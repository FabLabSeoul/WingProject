@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic communication between USARTy and USARTz using DMA 
capability. USARTy and USARTz can be USART1 and USART2 or USART2 and USART3,
depending on the STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

First, the DMA transfers data from TxBuffer2 buffer to USARTz Transmit data 
register, then this data is sent to USARTy. Data received by USARTy is transferred
by DMA and stored in RxBuffer1 then compared with the send ones and the result 
of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus1" variable.
 
In the same time, the DMA transfers data from TxBuffer1 buffer to USARTy Transmit
data register, then this data is sent to USARTz. Data received by USARTz is
transferred by DMA and stored in RxBuffer2 then compared with the send ones and
the result of this comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus2" variable. 

USARTy and USARTz configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 230400 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in USART/DMA_Polling/platform_config.h file

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN10 (USART1) and 
      CN9 (USART2).
      @note In this case USART2 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software on PD.05 
            and PD.06 respectively.

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect USART2 Tx pin (PD.05) to USART3 Rx pin (PC.11)
    - Connect USART2 Rx pin (PD.06) to USART3 Tx pin	(PC.10)
      @note In this case USART3 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software.
            Make sure that jumpers JP19 and JP18 are open.
              
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN12 (USART1) and 
      CN8 (USART2).
    
  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN6 (USART1) and 
      CN5 (USART2).
      @note In this case USART2 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software on PD.05 
            and PD.06 respectively. 
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_dma.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
          
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit USART/DMA_Polling/platform_config.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
