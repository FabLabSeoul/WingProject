@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how  to use the USART in Smartcard mode. 
The example gives only the possibility to read the ATR and decode it into 
predefined buffer.
First, the code is waiting for an card insertion. If a card is detected through
the EXTI Line interrupt (connected to the Smartcard detect pin), a reset signal
is applied to the card through its reset pin.
As response to this reset, the card transmit the ATR which will be stored in 
predefined buffer. Once the ATR is received, it is decoded and stored in a specific
structure (SC_A2R) and the card protocol type is stored in a variable.
ATRDecodeStatus variable must be equal to 1 (PASSED) when the sequence succeed.

The used Smartcard should be ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible.

SC_USART configured as follow:
  - Word Length = 9 Bits
  - 0.5 Stop Bit
  - Even parity
  - BaudRate = 12096 baud
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Tx and Rx enabled
  - USART Clock enabled
  - USART CPOL: Clock is active low
  - USART CPHA: Data is captured on the second edge 
  - USART LastBit: The clock pulse of the last data bit is not output to 
                   the SCLK pin

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line),
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density)
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
    development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in USART/Smartcard/platform_config.h file

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Plug a Smartcard (ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible) into  the dedicated Smartcard 
      connector CN5.
      @note In this case USART3 Tx and CK pins are full remapped by software.
            Make sure that Jumper 11 (JP11), Jumper 12 (JP12) and Jumper 13 (JP13)
            are in position 1<-->2.
        
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Plug a Smartcard (ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible) into  the dedicated Smartcard 
      connector CN18.
      @note Make sure that Jumper 15 (JP15) and Jumper 16 (JP16) are fitted.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up   
    - Plug a Smartcard (ISO7816-3 T=0 compatible) into the dedicated Smartcard 
      connector CN16.

  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_exti.c
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c 
  - misc.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
            
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit USART/Smartcard/platform_config.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
