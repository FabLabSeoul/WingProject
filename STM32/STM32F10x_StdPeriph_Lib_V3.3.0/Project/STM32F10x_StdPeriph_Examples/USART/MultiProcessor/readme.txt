@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the USART in multi-processor mode.
USARTy and USARTz can be USART1 and USART2 or USART2 and USART3 respectively, 
depending on the STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

First, the USARTy and USARTz address are set to 0x1 and 0x2. The USARTy send 
continusouly the character 0x33 to the USARTz. The USARTz toggle LED1, LED2, LED3 
and LED4 pins while receiving 0x33.

When a falling edge is applied on BUTTON_KEY EXTI line, an interrupt is generated
and in the EXTI9_5_IRQHandler routine, the USARTz is entered in mute mode and still
in this mode (no LED toggling) until a rising edge is applied on BUTTON_WAKEUP 
EXTI Line 0.
In this interrupt routine the USARTy send the character of address mark (0x102)
to wakeup USARTz. The LED restart toggling.

USARTy and USARTz configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
  - Word Length = 9 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in USART/MultiProcessor/platform_config.h or stm32_eval.h file.

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN9 and CN10.
      @note In this case USART2 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software on 
            PD.05 and PD.06 respectively. 
    - Use Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9)
    - Use Wakeup push-button connected to pin PA.00 (EXTI Line0)
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, 
      PC.08 and PC.09 pins

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect USART2 Tx pin (PD.05) to USART3 Rx pin (PC.11)
    - Connect USART2 Rx pin (PD.06) to USART3 Tx pin	(PC.10)
    - Use Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9)
    - Use Wakeup push-button connected to pin PA.00 (EXTI Line0) 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.07, PD.13, PF.03
      and PD.04 pins   
      @note In this case USART3 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software.
            Make sure that jumpers JP19 and JP18 are open.
            Make sure that the Jumper 14 (JP14) is in position 2<-->3. 
    
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN12 and CN8.
    - Use Key push-button connected to pin PG.08 (EXTI Line8)
    - Use Wakeup push-button connected to pin PA.00 (EXTI Line0)
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins
      @note Make sure that the Jumper 4 (JP4) is in position 1<-->2. 

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up
