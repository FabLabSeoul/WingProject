@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates the dual Flash boot capability of XL-Density devices:
boot from Flash memory Bank1 or Bank2.

At startup, if BFB2 option bit is reset and the boot pins are in the boot from main
Flash memory configuration, the device boots from Flash memory Bank1 or Bank2,
depending on the activation of the bank. The active banks are checked in the following
order: Bank2, followed by Bank1.
The active bank is identified by the value programmed at the base address of the 
bank (corresponding to the initial stack pointer value in the interrupt vector table). 
For further details, please refer to AN2606 "STM32 microcontroller system memory boot mode."

To demonstrate this feature, this example provides two programs:
  - 1st program will be loaded in Flash Bank1 (starting from @ 0x08000000), for this
     you have to enable BOOT_FROM_BANK1 define in main.c 
  - 2nd program will be loaded in Flash Bank2 (starting from @ 0x08080000), for this
     you have to enable BOOT_FROM_BANK2 define in main.c 

Once these two programs are loaded and boot pins set in boot from Flash memory,
after reset the device will boot from Bank1 (default). Then you have to follow
the instructions provided on the LCD:
  - "Joystick-DOWN: reset BFB2 bit to Boot from Bank2" => when pushing the Joystick
     DOWN button, BFB2 option bit will be reset then a system (SW) reset will be
     generated. After startup from reset, the device will boot from Bank2. 
      - Note: when booting from Bank2 the same menu will be displayed
 
  - "Joystick-UP: set BFB2 bit to Boot from Bank1" => when pushing the Joystick
     UP button, BFB2 option bit will be set then a system (SW) reset will be
     generated. After startup from reset, the device will boot from Bank1.       
 
  - "Joystick-SEL: program to 0x0 the base @ of Bank1/2" => when pushing the Joystick
     SEL button, the content of address 0x08080000 and 0x08000000 will be programmed to 0x0.
       - If the program was previously booting from Bank2 (i.e. BFB2 bit is reset), 
         in this case after reset no program is executed and the Bootloader code
         is executed instead. 
       - If the program was previously booting from Bank1 (i.e. BFB2 bit is set), 
         in this case after reset no program is executed.
       - You have to load again the two programs to Bank1 and Bank2.
 
@b Important Note
=================
When BFB2 bit is cleared and Bank2 or/and Bank1 contain valid user application code,
the Bootloader will always jump to this code and never continue normal code execution 
(i.e. it’s no more possible to use the Bootloader for code upgrade and option bytes
programming). As consequence, if the user has cleared BFB2 bit (to boot from Bank2),
in order to be able to execute the embedded Bootloader code he has to: 
   - either, set BFB2 bit to 1
   - or, program the content of address 0x08080000 and 0x08000000 to 0x0
=> This example allows performing the two actions described above.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F10x XL-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (XL-Density) 
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any development board.
