@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to STOP mode and wake-up using EXTI
Line interrupts. The EXTI Line sources are PB.09/PG.08 and RTC Alarm.

The EXTI line9/8 is configured to generate interrupt on falling edge.
The EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is configured to generate interrupt on rising edge and
the RTC time base is set to 1 second using the external low speed oscillator(LSE).

The system clock is set to 24 MHz on Value line devices and to 72 MHz on other 
devices using the external high speed oscillator(HSE).

The system enters and exits STOP mode as following:
After 2 second from system start-up, the RTC is configured to generate an Alarm
event in 3 second then the system enters STOP mode. To wake-up from STOP mode you
have to apply a rising edge on EXTI line9/8, otherwise the  RTC Alarm will wake-up
the system within 3 second. After exit from STOP the system clock is reconfigured
to its previous state (as HSE and PLL are disabled in STOP mode).
Then after a delay the system will enter again in STOP mode and exit in the way
described above. This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

Three leds LED1, LED2 and LED3 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED1 on: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 off: system in STOP mode
 - LED2 is toggled if EXTI Line9/8 is used to exit from STOP 
 - LED3 is toggled if EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is used to exit from STOP

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2 and LED3 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07 and PC.08 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9).
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2 and LED3 leds connected respectively to PD.07, PD.13 and PF.03 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9).

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2 and LED3 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7 and PF.08 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG.08 (EXTI Line8).

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2 and LED3 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07 and PC.08 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PB.09 (EXTI Line9).

@note For power consumption measurement in STOP mode you have to: 
- Modify the example to configure all unused GPIO port pins in Analog Input mode
  (floating input trigger OFF). Refer to GPIO\IOToggle example for more details. 
- Replace jumper JP9 in the STM3210B-EVAL board, JP12 in the STM3210E-EVAL, 
  JP23 (position 1-2) in the STM3210C-EVAL board or JP8 (position 1-2) in the 
  STM32100B-EVAL board by an ampermeter.
