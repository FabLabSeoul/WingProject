@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector using
an external interrupt line. In this example, EXTI line 16 is configured to generate 
an interrupt on each rising or falling edge of the PVD output signal (which 
indicates that the Vdd voltage is below the PVD threshold).
In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled every 
time the voltage drops below or  the target threshold.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1 led connected to PC.06 pin
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1 led connected to PD.07 pin

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1 led connected to PF.06 pin

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1 led connected to PC.06 pin

@note
- Use a variable DC power supply connected to the 3V3 input to the evaluation 
  board and droping the voltage below 2.7V. 
         
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c   
  - stm32f10x_pwr.c   
  - stm32f10x_exti.c 
  - misc.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c
  - stm32f10x_spi.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
  - stm32_eval.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
     
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit stm32_eval.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example in standalone mode (without debugger connection)
