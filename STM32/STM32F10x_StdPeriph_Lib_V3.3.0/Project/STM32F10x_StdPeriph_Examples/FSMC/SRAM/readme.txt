@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the FSMC firmware library and
an associate driver to perform read/write operations on the IS61WV51216BLL SRAM
memory mounted on STM3210E-EVAL board.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F10x High-Density and XL-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) evaluation board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_fsmc.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_exti.c
  - misc.c
  - stm32f10x_usart.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c
  - stm32f10x_spi.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
  - stm32_eval.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
  - stm3210e_eval_fsmc_sram.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3210E_EVAL)
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit stm32_eval.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
   
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
