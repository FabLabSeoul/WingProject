@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 7 PWM signals 
with 4 different duty cycles (50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5%).

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices. For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density 
Value line devices, SystemCoreClock is set to 24 MHz.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
The channel 1 and channel 1N duty cycle is set to 50%
The channel 2 and channel 2N duty cycle is set to 37.5%
The channel 3 and channel 3N duty cycle is set to 25%
The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5%
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c  
  - stm32f10x_tim.c  
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
      
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.
