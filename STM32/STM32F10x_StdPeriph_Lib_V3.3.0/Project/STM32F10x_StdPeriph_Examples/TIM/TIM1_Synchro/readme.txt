@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM1 and Timers (TIM3 and TIM4) in parallel mode.

Timers synchronisation in parallel mode:

1/ TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/ TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM1,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger for both slaves
 - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters
  are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

o For Low-density, Medium-density, High-density and Connectivity line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 72 MHz, Prescaler = 0 so the TIM1 counter clock is 72 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM1 is running at:
  TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 281.250 KHz
  and the duty cycle is equal to: TIM1_CCR1/(TIM1_ARR + 1) = 50%

  The TIM3 is running at: 
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM3 period +1)* (Repetion_Counter+1)) = 18.750 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 33.3%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM4 period +1)* (Repetion_Counter+1)) = 28.125 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 50%
  
o For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density Value line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 24 MHz, Prescaler = 0 so the TIM1 counter clock is 24 MHz.
  TIM1 frequency = 93.75 KHz
  TIM3 frequency = 6.25 KHz
  TIM4 frequency = 9.375 KHz

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
   - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1 CH1 (PE.08) Remapped pin
      - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06) Remapped pin
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
   - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1 CH1 (PA.08)
      - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06)  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)  
  
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
