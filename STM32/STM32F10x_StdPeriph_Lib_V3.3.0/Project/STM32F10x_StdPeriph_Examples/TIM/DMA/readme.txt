@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use DMA with TIM1 Update request
to transfer Data from memory to TIM1 Capture Compare Register3.

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices. For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density 
Value line devices, SystemCoreClock is set to 24 MHz.

The objective is to configure TIM1 channel 3 to generate complementary PWM
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz:
   - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
and a variable duty cycle that is changed by the DMA after a specific number of
Update DMA request.

The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM1 Repetion counter,
each 3 Update Requests, the TIM1 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
value defined by the SRC_Buffer.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32100B-EVAL STM3210C-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:  
        - TIM1 CH3  (PA.10)
        - TIM1 CH3N (PB.15)  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32F10x_dma.c
  - stm32F10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32F10x_rcc.c  
  - stm32F10x_tim.c  
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x) 
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
