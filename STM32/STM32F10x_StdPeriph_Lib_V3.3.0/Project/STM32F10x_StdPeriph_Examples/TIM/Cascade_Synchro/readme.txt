@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in cascade mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in cascade mode:

1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output  

2/TIM3 is slave for TIM2 and Master for TIM4,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger 
 - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
	  are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).
 - The TIM3 Update event is used as Trigger Output. 

3/TIM4 is slave for TIM3,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR2(TIM3) is used as input trigger
 - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter  are controlled by the
   Master trigger output signal(TIM3 update event).

o For Low-density, Medium-density, High-density and Connectivity line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 72 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency :
  TIM2 frequency = (TIM2 counter clock)/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 281.250 KHz 
  and the duty cycle = TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

  The TIM3 is running at:
  (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 70.312 KHz and a duty cycle equal 
  to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 25%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM3 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 17.578 Hz and a duty cycle equal 
  to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 25%  

o For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density Value line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 24 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 24 MHz.
  So TIM2 frequency = 93.750 KHz,
  TIM3 is running at 23.437 KHz,
  and TIM4 is running at 5.85 KHz

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00) 
        - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06) Remapped pin
        - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 

  - STM3210E-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL and STM32100B Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00) 
        - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
        - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06)    
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
