@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in parallel mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in parallel mode:

1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM2,
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger for both slaves 
 - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters are controlled 
   by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

o For Low-density, Medium-density, High-density and Connectivity line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 72 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 72 MHz.
  The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency:
  TIM2 frequency = TIM2 counter clock/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 281.250 KHz 
  and the duty cycle is equal to TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

  The TIM3 is running at:
  (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 28.1250 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 
  TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 30%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 56.250 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 
  TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 60%

o For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density Value line devices:
  The TIMxCLK is fixed to 24 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 24 MHz.
  TIM2 frequency = 93.75 KHz 
  TIM3 frequency = 9.375 KHz 
  TIM4 frequency = 18.75 KHz

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00)
      - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06) Remapped pin
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00)
      - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06) 
      - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06) 
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
