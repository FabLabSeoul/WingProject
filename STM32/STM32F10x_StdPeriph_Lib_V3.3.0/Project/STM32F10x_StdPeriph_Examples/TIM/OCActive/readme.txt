@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different delays.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM3 counter clock at 1 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices and to 24 MHz for Low-Density Value line and
Medium-Density Value line devices

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM3_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM3 counter clock  = 1000 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 1000 ms.

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 500:
TIM3_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 500 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 250:
TIM3_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 250 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 250 ms.

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 125:
TIM3_CH4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 125 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a signal with a delay equal to 125 ms.

The delay correspond to the time difference between PC.06 and 
TIM3_CHx signal rising edges in case of STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and 
STM3210B-EVAL 

The delay correspond to the time difference between PD.07 and 
TIM3_CHx signal rising edges in case of STM3210C-EVAL

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM3 pins(TIM3 full remapped pins) to an oscilloscope to
      monitor the different waveforms:
       - PD.07
       - PC.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PC.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PC.08 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PC.09 (TIM3_CH4)

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PC.06
       - PA.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PA.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PB.00 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PB.01 (TIM3_CH4)
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - stm32f10x_tim.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x) 
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user
