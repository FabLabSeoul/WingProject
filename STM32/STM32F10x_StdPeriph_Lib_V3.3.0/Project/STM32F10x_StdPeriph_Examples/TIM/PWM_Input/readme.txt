@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM3 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices. For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density 
Value line devices, SystemCoreClock is set to 24 MHz.

TIM3 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM3 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle we use the TIM3 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM3_IRQHandler routine, the frequency and the duty cycle of the external 
signal are computed. 
The "Frequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
Frequency = TIM3 counter clock / TIM3_CCR2 in Hz, 
The "DutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:
DutyCycle = (TIM3_CCR1*100)/(TIM3_CCR2) in %.

For Low-density, Medium-density, High-density and Connectivity line devices, 
the minimum frequency value to measure is 1100 Hz. 
For Low-Density Value line and Medium-Density Value line devices, the minimum
frequency value to measure is 366 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210C-EVAL  Set-up 
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM3 CH2 pin (PA.07).   
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c  
  - misc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions
