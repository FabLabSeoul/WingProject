@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Inactive 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel.

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM2 counter clock at 1 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices and to 24 MHz for Low-Density Value line and
Medium-Density Value line devices

The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM2_CC1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM2 counter clock  = 1000 ms
so the PC.06  is reset after a delay equal to 1000 ms.

The TIM2 CCR2 register value is equal to 500:
TIM2_CC2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 500 ms
so the PC.07  is reset after a delay equal to 500 ms.

The TIM2 CCR3 register value is equal to 250:
TIM2_CC3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 250 ms
so the PC.08  is reset after a delay equal to 250 ms.

The TIM2 CCR4 register value is equal to 125:
TIM2_CC4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 125 ms
so the PC.09  is reset after a delay equal to 125 ms.

While the counter is lower than the Output compare registers values, which 
determines the Output delay, the PC.06, PC.07, PC.08 and PC.09 pin are turned on. 

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, these pins are turned off.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - PC.06
        - PC.07
        - PC.08 
        - PC.09
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_tim.c
  - misc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
      
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
