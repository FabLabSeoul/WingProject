@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the bxCAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 100 Kbits/s. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbits/s. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line),
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density)
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
    development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file   

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.07, PD.13, PF.03
      and PD.04 pins
      
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, 
      PF.08 and PF.09 pins

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
