@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control Leds by pressing  
key push button.
	
The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

@note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
	
	The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
		- ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
		- RTR = Data
		- DLC = 1 byte
		- Data: Led number that should be turned ON

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line),
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density)
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
    development board.

		  - Connector 1 DB9_PIN7 to Connector 2 DB9_PIN7  (CAN_H) 
		  @note JP3 must be fitted.
		  
@note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing on the 
      key) or receiver.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_can.c 
  - stm32f10x_exti.c  
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c   
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c
  - stm32f10x_spi.c
  - misc.c
  - stm32_eval.c       (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)  
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)   
         
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit CAN/Normal/platform_config.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
- or edit stm32_eval.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
- In the first time the all leds are OFF.
- By Pressing on Key Button : LED1 turn ON and all other Leds are OFF, on the N
  eval-boards connected to the bus. 
- Press on Key Button again to send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other Leds 
  are OFF on the N eval-boards.
