@par Example Description 

This example describes how to set the CortexM3 vector table in a specific 
address other than default using the NVIC_SetVectorTable function from the 
misc.h/.c driver.

This can be used to build program which will be loaded into Flash memory by an
application previously programmed from the Flash memory base address. 
Such application can be In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART) or
Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU, through USB).

These applications are available for download from the ST microcontrollers 
website: www.st.com/stm32

The associated program implements a "Delay" function based on SysTick end of count
interrupt, and toggles four leds with timing defined by the "Delay" function.

When using the IAP to load your porgram, the vector table must be relocated at
address 0x08002000.

When using the DFU to load your porgram, the vector table must be relocated at
address 0x08003000.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up   
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
      
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 leds connected respectively to PD.07, PD.13, PF.03
      and PD.04 pins
    
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up   
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
     
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration:
<ul>
    <li> MDK-ARM 
         - In the project option menu, select 'Target' window and enter 0x08002000 
           as IROM start address
         - In the project option menu, select 'Linker' window and enter 0x08002000 
           as R/O base address                    

    <li> EWARM5 
         - Use "stm32f10x_flash_offset.icf" as linker file

    <li> RIDE 
         - In the Application options -> script menu, set "Use Default Script File" 
           to "No" and use "stm32f10x_flash_offset.ld" as Script File. 
           This linker is configured for STM32 XL-density devices. To use it with
           other STM32 devices, this linker should be updated.
    
    <li> HiTOP 
         - From linker\HiTOP\[target], copy the "link_offset" and "STM32F10x_offset.lsl"
           to "Settings" folder.
         - In project -> settings -> project -> tool settings ->linker 
             use "link_offset.lnk" as linker file. 
         - Add the "setstack.asm" to the workspace.
         
    <li> TrueSTUDIO 
         - In the project properties window, select 'C/C++ Build'->settings node then 
           the 'C Linker'->General node and use "stm32f10x_flash_offset.ld" as Script File.
           This linker is configured for STM32 STM32F10x XL-density devices. To use it with
           other STM32 devices, this linker should be updated. 
         
</ul>        
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_exti.c  
  - misc.c 
  - stm32f10x_usart.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c
  - stm32f10x_spi.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
  - stm32_eval.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Edit stm32_eval.h file to select the evaluation board you will use.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section. 
        
- In the main.c and linker files, the vector table is relocated at address 0x08002000.
  You can modify this address depending on the requirement of your application.    
- Rebuild all files 
- Convert the program image to a binary file, *.bin, then you can download and
  run it using the IAP or DFU application.
