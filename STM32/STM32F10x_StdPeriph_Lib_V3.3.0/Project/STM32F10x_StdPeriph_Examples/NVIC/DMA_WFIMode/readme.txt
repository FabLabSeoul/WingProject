@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enters the system to WFI mode with DMA transfer enabled
and wake-up from this mode by the DMA End of Transfer interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 72 MHz (24MHz on Value line), 
the DMA1 Channely is configured to transfer 10 data from the EVAL COM1 USART data 
register to a predefined buffer, DST_Buffer, and to generate an interrupt at the 
end of the transfer.
The EVAL COM1 USART receives data from Hyperterminal.
A LED1 is toggled with a frequency depending on the system clock, this is used 
to indicate whether the MCU is in WFI or RUN mode. 

A falling edge on the selected EXTI Line will put the core in the WFI mode, 
causing the led pin to stop toggling.
To wake-up from WFI mode you have to send the sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
from the Hyperterminal to the EVAL COM1 USART. These bytes will be transferred 
by the DMA from the EVAL COM1 receive data register to the predefined buffer, 
then generates an interrupt which exits the system from WFI mode. 
The LED1 restarts toggling and a LED2 will toggle if the buffer is correctly 
received else a LED3 is toggled.
