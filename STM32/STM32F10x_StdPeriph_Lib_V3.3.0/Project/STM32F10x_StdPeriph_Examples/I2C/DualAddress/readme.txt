@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to transfer two data buffer from I2C1
to I2C2 using its both addresses in the same application.

The example consist in two parts:
1. First step, the I2C1 master transmitter sends the Tx_Buffer1 data buffer to the 
   slave I2C2 which saves the received data in Rx_Buffer1. I2C2 is addressed in 
   this case by its first slave address I2C2_SLAVE1_ADDRESS7 programmed in the
   I2C2 OAR1 register.
   The transmitted and received buffers are compared to check that all data
   have been correctly transferred.
2. Second step, the I2C2 is now addressed by its second slave address
   I2C2_SLAVE2_ADDRESS7 programmed in the I2C2 OAR2 register. The Tx_Buffer2
   contents are transmitted by the master I2C1 to the slave I2C2 which stores
   them into Rx_Buffer2.
   A second comparison takes place between the transmitted and received buffers.

The communication clock speed is set to 200KHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity-Line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11) are 
    already used by Ethernet PHY module. 
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Medium-Density Value line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11)
    are already used by HDMI-CEC module.  

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin    

@note The pull-up resitors are already implemented on the STM3210B-EVAL and
      STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards.     

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c   
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
        
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
