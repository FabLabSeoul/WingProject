@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to manage data transfer from 
master transmitter to slave receiver and from slave transmitter to master receiver 
using interrupts.

After enabling the two I2C peripherals, both event and buffer interrupts for 
I2C1 and I2C2 and error interrupt for I2C2, the transfer in 7-bit addressing 
mode starts after I2C1 start condition generation.

First, the master transmitter I2C1 send I2C1_Buffer_Tx data buffer to the 
salve receiver I2C2. Data received by I2C2 is stored in I2C2_Buffer_Rx buffer.
Each time an event occurs on the master or the slave, it is managed in the I2C1 
or I2C2 interrupts routines, respectively. 
The PEC value is also transmitted from master transmitter to slave receiver and 
it is stored in the same reception buffer I2C2_Buffer_Rx.
The transmitted and received buffers are compared to check that all data have 
been correctly transferred (except the PEC value). This transfer status is stored 
in TransferStatus1 variable.

Once the Re-Start condition is sent, thus the second step is started and the 
I2C2_Buffer_Tx will be sent from the slave transmitter I2C2 to be recieved by 
the master receiver I2C1 and stored in I2C1_Buffer_Rx. 
Each time an event occurs on the master or the slave, it is managed in the I2C1 
or I2C2 interrupts routines, respectively. 
The transmitted and received buffers are compared to check that all data have been 
correctly transferred. This transfer status is stored in TransferStatus2 variable.

The communication clock speed is set to 200KHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity-Line) evaluation board since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11) are 
    already used by Ethernet PHY module.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Medium-Density Value line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11) 
    are already used by HDMI-CEC module.     
    
  - STM3210E-EVAL & STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin

@note The pull-up resitors are already implemented on the STM3210B-EVAL and
      STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards.
