@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to transfer a data buffer from I2C1 to
I2C2 in 10-bit addressing mode.

After enabling the two I2C peripherals, the transfer in 10-bit addressing mode
starts after the I2C1 start condition is generated. Each time an event occurs on
the master or the slave, it is managed on I2C1 or I2C2, respectively.
In this application, Tx_Buffer is transmitted from the master I2C1 to the slave
I2C2 and stored into Rx_Buffer. The transmitted and received buffers are compared
to check that all data have been correctly transferred.

The communication clock speed is set to 300KHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity-Line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11) are 
    already used by Ethernet PHY module. 
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Medium-Density Value line) evaluation boards since the I2C2 pins (PB10 and PB11)
    are already used by HDMI-CEC module.     

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
    - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin    

@note The pull-up resitors are already implemented on the STM3210B-EVAL and
      STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)
     
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.
