@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel14.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the ADCConvertedValue variable.
The ADC1 clock is set to 12 MHz on Value line devices and to 14MHz on other 
devices.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and
    XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV2)

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_adc.c
  - stm32f10x_dma.c
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c

- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Use STM32F10x system source file "system_stm32f10x.c" provided with this example.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
