@par Example Description 

This example describes how to trigger ADC regular and injected groups channels 
conversion using two external line events. Discontinuous mode is enabled for regular
group channel conversion and configured to convert one regular channel on each 
external trigger.

ADC1 is configured to start regular group channel conversion on EXTI11 event.
On detection of the first rising edge on PE.11 pin, the conversion of the first regular
channel (ADC channel4) is done and its converted value is transfered by DMA to 
ADC_RegularConvertedValueTab table. On the following edge detection, the second 
regular channel (ADC channel14) is automatically converted and its converted value
is stored by DMA in the same table. The number of transmitted data by DMA, in this 
example is limited to 64 data.

The procedure is repeated for both regular channels on each EXTI11 event.
ADC1 is configured to start injected group channel conversion on EXTI15 event.
On detection of the first rising edge on PE.15 pin all selected injected channels, which
are two in this example (ADC channel11 and channel12), are converted and an interrupt 
is generated on JEOC flag rising at the end of all injected channels conversion. 
Both injected channels converted results are stored in ADC_InjectedConvertedValueTab 
table inside the interrupt routine.
The procedure is repeated for injected channels on each EXTI15 event.
The ADC1 clock is set to 12 MHz on Value line devices and to 14MHz on other 
devices.
