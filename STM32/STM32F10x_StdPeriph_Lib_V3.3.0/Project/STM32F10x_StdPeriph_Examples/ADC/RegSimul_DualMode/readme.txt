@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use ADC1 and ADC2 in regular simultaneous dual mode.
ADC1 is configured to convert channel14 and channel17 regular channels continuously.
ADC2 is configured to convert channel11 and channel12 regular channels continuously.
The connection between internal Vref and channel17 is enabled for ADC1.

Once the regular channels conversion is started by software, channel14 is converted
on ADC1 and channel11 is converted on ADC2 on the same time. The 32bits conversion 
result is then stored on ADC1 DR register. The DMA will transfer this data which
will be stored ADC_DualConvertedValueTab table. Consecutively to those conversion,
channel17 is converted on ADC1 and channel12 on ADC2. The combined conversion
result is also transfered by DMA to the same destination buffer. 

The same procedure is repeated until the specified number of data to be transfered
by DMA is reached.

The ADCs clocks are set to 14 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density and Low-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL 
    (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and
    STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a known voltage, between 0-3.3V, to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin 
      PC.04 (potentiometer RV1), ADC Channel11 mapped on pin PC.01 and ADC 
      Channel12 mapped on pin PC.02.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a known voltage, between 0-3.3V, to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin 
      PC.04 (potentiometer RV1), ADC Channel11 mapped on pin PC.01 and ADC 
      Channel12 mapped on pin PC.02.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a known voltage, between 0-3.3V, to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin 
      PC.04 (potentiometer RV1), ADC Channel11 mapped on pin PC.01 and ADC 
      Channel12 mapped on pin PC.02.          

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_adc.c
  - stm32f10x_dma.c
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c

- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Use STM32F10x system source file "system_stm32f10x.c" provided with this example.

@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
