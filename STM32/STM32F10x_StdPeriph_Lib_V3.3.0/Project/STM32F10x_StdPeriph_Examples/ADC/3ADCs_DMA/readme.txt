@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the 3 ADCs in independent conversions. 
Two of them; ADC1 and ADC3 are transferring continuously converted data using DMA
while ADC2 converted data are stored using End of conversion interrupt.

ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel14. Each time an end of
conversion occurs the DMA1 transfers, in circular mode, the converted data from 
ADC1 DR register to the ADC1_ConvertedValue variable.

ADC2 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel13. Each time an end of
conversion occurs an end of conversion interrupt is generated and inside the
interrupt routine the converted data are read from ADC2 DR register and stored
into the ADC2_ConvertedValue variable.

ADC3 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel12. Each time an end of
conversion occurs the DMA2 transfers, in circular mode, the converted data from
ADC3 DR register to the ADC3_ConvertedValue variable.

The ADCs clocks are set to 14 MHz.

The result of ADC1, ADC2 and ADC3 conversion is monitored through the three
variables: ADC1ConvertedValue, ADC2ConvertedValue and ADC3ConvertedValue.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F10x High-Density and XL-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC3 Channel12 mapped on pin PC.02
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC2 Channel13 mapped on pin PC.03
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC1 Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1 on STM3210E-EVAL board)
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_adc.c
  - stm32f10x_dma.c
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - misc.c

- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
- Use STM32F10x system source file "system_stm32f10x.c" provided with this example.  
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.
