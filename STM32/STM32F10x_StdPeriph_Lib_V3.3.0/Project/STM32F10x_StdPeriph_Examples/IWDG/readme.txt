@par Example Description 

This example shows how to reload at regulate period the IWDG counter using the
SysTick interrupt. The IWDG timeout is set to 280 ms (the timeout may vary due
to LSI frequency dispersion).

SysTick is configured to generate an interrupt every 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt
service routine (ISR), the IWDG counter is reloaded to prevent an IWDG reset, and
LED2 is toggled.
An EXTI is connected to a specific GPIO pin and configured to generate an interrupt
on its falling edge.
In the NVIC, this EXTI line corresspondant interrupt vector is enabled with a 
priority equal to 0, and the SysTick interrupt vector priority is set to 1 
(EXTI IT > SysTick IT).

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: when the EXTI Line event is
triggered (by pressing the Key push-button on the board), the corresponding interrupt
is served. In the ISR, the LED2turns off and the EXTI line pending bit is 
not cleared. So the CPU executes the EXTI line ISR indefinitely and the SysTick 
ISR is never entered (IWDG counter not reloaded).
As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG generates a reset.
If the IWDG reset is generated, LED1 is turned on after the system resumes operation.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely reloaded in
the SysTick ISR, which prevents any IWDG reset.

In this example the system clock is set to 24 MHz on Value line devices and to
72MHz on other devices.
