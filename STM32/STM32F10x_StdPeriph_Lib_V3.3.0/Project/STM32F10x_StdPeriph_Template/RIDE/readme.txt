 @par Directory contents
 
 - project .rprj/.rapp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                        structure that produces an executable image with RIDE7.
                
 - stm32f10x_flash_extsram.ld: This file is the RAISONANCE linker script used to 
                               place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH 
                               and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in external 
                               SRAM. 
                               You can customize this file to your need.
                           
 @par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.rprj project.
 - In the configuration toolbar(Project->properties) select the project config:
     - STM32100B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density Value line devices
     - STM3210C-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Connectivity line devices
     - STM3210B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density devices
     - STM3210E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density devices
 - Rebuild all files: Project->build project
 - Load project image: Debug->start(ctrl+D)
 - Run program: Debug->Run(ctrl+F9)  

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
