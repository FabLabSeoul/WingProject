 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32100B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density Value 
       line devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F10X_MD_VL, USE_STM32100B_EVAL
           
     - STM3210C-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Connectivity line devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F10X_CL, USE_STM3210C_EVAL

     - STM3210B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F10X_MD, USE_STM3210B_EVAL

     - STM3210E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F10X_HD, USE_STM3210E_EVAL

     - STM32F10X_XL: to configure the project for STM32 XL-density devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F10X_XL, USE_STM3210E_EVAL

 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
