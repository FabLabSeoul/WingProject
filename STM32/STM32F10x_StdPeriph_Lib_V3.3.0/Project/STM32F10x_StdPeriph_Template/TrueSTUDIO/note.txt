The C runtime library include many functions, including some that typically 
handle I/O. The I/O related runtime functions include printf(), fopen(), fclose(),
and many others.

It is common to redirect the I/O from these functions to the actual embedded 
platform, such as redirecting printf() output to an LCD display or a serial cable,
or to redirect file operations like fopen() and fclose() to some Flash file 
system middleware.

The free Lite version of TrueSTUDIO do not support I/O redirection, and instead 
have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library.

To support printf() redirection in the full version, just add the following code 
in in _write() function in the TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" 
located at TrueSTUDIO Pro install directory.

/*****************************************/
   int Index;
  
   for (Index = 0; Index < len; Index++)
   {
      __io_putchar( *ptr++ );
   }

   return len;
