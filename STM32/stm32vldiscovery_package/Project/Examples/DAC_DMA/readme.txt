@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use one DAC channel mode with DMA to generate an
escalator signal on DAC channel1 output.

DAC channel1 conversion is configured to be triggered by TIM6 TRGO triggers and
without noise/triangle wave generation. 8bit right data alignement is selected
since we choose to acces DAC_DHR8R1 register.
DMA2 channel3 is configured to transfer continuously, byte by byte, a 6-byte
buffer to the DAC1 register DAC_DHR8R1.

The transfered 6bytes buffer is made to have an escalator signal on DAC channel1
output. DAC channel1 is then enabled. Once TIM6 is enabled, each TIM6 TRGO update
event generate a DMA request which transfer data  to the DAC1 register and DAC
conversion is started. The escalator signal can be visualized by connecting PA.04
pin to an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, XL-Density,
    Medium-Density Value line and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line) and 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) evaluation boards and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.   

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 pin to an oscilloscope 
    @note Make shure that jumper JP2 is open.
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 pin to an oscilloscope
    @note Make shure that jumper JP15 is open.
        
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 pin to an oscilloscope
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_dac.c 
  - stm32f10x_dma.c 
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - stm32f10x_tim.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\CM3\DeviceSupport\ST\STM32F10x)   
        
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
